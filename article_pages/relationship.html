      What is a relationship? I saw my friends enjoying relationship but I never had this thought to have a relationship in my life. I always had this thought that I am not prepared for a relationship and will not be able to manage the things and somewhere in my mind was afraid too. <br><br>
      But one day I asked myself a question that, why? The answer was very simple, I enjoyed being in friendship more than relationship and I always enjoyed giving time to myself by listening to music, writing, and playing football, Music and Writing became my Love and Hobby.<br><br>
      I think the words are not enough to explain a Relationship; it is just the emotions that you feel. A relationship can be between parents and their children, brother and sister, and many others. The relationship of any kind is the most beautiful thing one has because it has love, care, and respect in it. But then there is this relationship between a boy and a girl. As it is said “Ek ladka or Ek ladki Sirf dost nahi ho sakte”. This is the most beautiful relationship like many other relationships. It is not just spending time with each other but it means understanding each other and learning out of it.<br><br>
      A relationship is not just that of two people sitting together and having a long conversation but the relationship is when two people are in such a bond where they feel comfortable, feel safe, feel involved, and where they can share whatever they want to without thinking much. In simple words when two people start understanding each other and feel free in their self-created world, it is a relationship.<br><br>
      My parents always taught me to be positive in life, they said not to hurt the feelings and emotions of other people and always go with the truth and I always try my best to follow my parents and learn new things from them. My father always said that enjoy your life to the fullest because it’s the only one we have got and do what you love but don’t go negative be positive always and he also said that don’t forget God when you get what you prayed for, yes it is true and I will never forget God because I think that before asking for something we get everything.<br><br>
      There are many people around you and it is hard to understand every person, there are many free suggestions around you and it is hard to take every suggestion. It is very important to give time to yourself because you only have the answers to every question, the only thing is that you will have to find answers in you and take the right decision. Everyone around you can show you different paths but in which direction to go is to be decided by you. Everyone wants a happy ending in their life but I don’t just want the happy ending, I also want to enjoy the journey to the happy end. <br><br>
      It is hard to explain a relationship and it is hard to understand as well but all you have to do is Love, Care and Respect each other which completes a relationship. The relationship is just a way in which two people are connected.<br><br>
      Most of the people in a relationship are like “She doesn’t want me to change and I don’t want her to change we are happy and we are enjoying the most in what we are today”.<br><br>
