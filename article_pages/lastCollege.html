      Before talking about the last day of college let me first ask that, do you know what FAMILY means? <br><br>

      Now, you might be thinking that how a family is related to the last day of college. But let me tell you it is very much related.
      No worries, let’s get into a ride of words to understand the meaning of family first.
      Hold on tight it will go on some height.<br><br>

      I think family is the place where you find yourself fulfilled with everything. It is the place where you feel comfortable, feel safe and where you understand each other better than any other. But the surprising factor here is that this place doesn’t have any physical existence it is just the emotional bond or connection between people. But this bond is such that they are most connected than any other person. They just Love, Care and Respect each other.<br><br>

      NOW let’s get back to the topic “LAST DAY OF COLLEGE”<br><br>

      If I’ll say that it was the normal day as usual than NO I’m wrong because it was not the normal day for me. It all starts with waking up in the morning and then realizing that today is my last day in the college, then suddenly the mind goes blank with one simple question that, WHAT NEXT? <br><br>

      On the last day, the full journey of the college rewinds with all the good and bad memories and the experience we had in the college remembering all friends we made, now it was the time to say goodbye to all the friends we had and the teachers with a smile on face and letting them know that how much you’re going to miss them. Seeing the corridors, classrooms, and the benches for the last time where we created most of the memories which makes you more emotional, the time spent roaming with the gang, bunking the lectures, marking proxy’s, making fun of each other for no reason, buttering teachers, and becoming responsible at some point. I knew that I was going to miss all the fun and the memories created at college. <br>
      But this was just about the CLASSROOM.<br><br>

      Then comes the second phase HOSTEL where I was most attached, it was the home away from home. It was the place where I spent most of my time and where I learned many things and had a great experience with a beautiful family called “Roommates”. It was hard for the first time to leave this beautiful place and move on but I hadn’t had any other option.<br><br>

      The fun we had and the experience we shared in the hostel cannot be expressed nor be explained in words.<br><br>

      From the strangers to the late-night gossips, sometimes arguing and sometimes fighting, from studies to planning next trip, night outs, birthday parties, love for the mess food, playing loud music, the most favourite part was playing truth and dare, and then running out of money. But now it was the time to move on and say goodbye to the hostel family taking all the memories with me and leaving back just a smile.<br><br>

      Now I think that you might have got the answer to the question that how the family is related to the last day of college.
      It was very difficult to even call a cab and leave the campus but I had to.<br><br>

      The last thing I remember about that day is, I had tears in my eyes and saying BYE.<br><br>

      

      The days passed and now I’m busy with my work but that doesn’t mean that it is all normal. I still miss my college days, the time I spent there, the memories I created and the experience I had.<br><br>

      But, <br>
      Growth is what I aim for in my life so I cannot afford to stop here in just remembering my past but I will have to keep on moving. Because what I think is that all the things are part of your journey you should not get dependent and stop at one place but you should focus on what is best for you at PRESENT and just move ALONG.<br><br>
